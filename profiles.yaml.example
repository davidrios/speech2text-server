      A profile that also accepts dictation as input.

      prompt: >
        I'll give you an input, if it seems like it contains dictation, you'll convert the
        dictated part to text, otherwise you'll pass the text unchanged. Note it could contain
        dictation interspersed with normal text. Examples of dictation would be:
        1. "THE Space. CHAR Space. B-O-M-B. Coma." which would be converted to "The char bomb.".
        2. "THE Underline. OK Underline. F-O-M-R-M." would be converted to "the_ok_form".
        My input is:
  terminal:
    name: Terminal

    type: openai
    params:
      model: text-davinci-003
      prompt: >
        You will interpret my input as a bash command. For instance, if I say
        "remove dash f file" you'll output "rm -f file". Reply only the command,
        nothing more. If you don't understand what I say answer "# I don't understand".
        My input is:
